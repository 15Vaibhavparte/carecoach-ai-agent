5. WHEN multiple medications are visible THEN the system SHALL identify the primary/most prominent medication

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a CareCoach user, I want to receive comprehensive drug information after image identification, so that I have all relevant details about my medication.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN medication is successfully identified THEN the system SHALL automatically call the existing DrugInfoTool
2. WHEN calling DrugInfoTool THEN the system SHALL pass the extracted medication name as input
3. WHEN DrugInfoTool returns data THEN the system SHALL include warnings, purpose, side effects, and usage instructions
4. WHEN DrugInfoTool fails THEN the system SHALL provide fallback information or error handling
5. WHEN information is retrieved THEN the system SHALL present it in a user-friendly format

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a CareCoach user, I want to interact with this feature through a web interface, so that I can easily access it from any device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

3. WHEN using the interface THEN the system SHALL provide a file browser option
4. WHEN processing is complete THEN the system SHALL display results in the same interface
5. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL display user-friendly error messages

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the feature to integrate with existing infrastructure, so that it maintains consistency with current CareCoach architecture.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the feature THEN the system SHALL use the existing lambda function architecture
2. WHEN processing requests THEN the system SHALL follow current API patterns and conventions
3. WHEN handling errors THEN the system SHALL use consistent error handling approaches
4. WHEN logging events THEN the system SHALL integrate with existing logging infrastructure
5. WHEN deploying THEN the system SHALL be compatible with current deployment processes

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a CareCoach user, I want the system to handle edge cases gracefully, so that I have a reliable experience even when images are problematic.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN no medication is detected in the image THEN the system SHALL inform the user and suggest retaking the photo
2. WHEN the image quality is too poor THEN the system SHALL provide guidance on improving image quality
3. WHEN the medication is not found in the drug database THEN the system SHALL inform the user and suggest manual lookup
4. WHEN network issues occur THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate retry mechanisms
5. WHEN processing takes too long THEN the system SHALL provide timeout handling with user feedback
